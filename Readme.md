Thoughts on the code.
Bad

1. First, I am confused in Job and Booking terminology. I believe there should be different Controllers for each
   JobController
   BookingController
2. Too many modifications of data in code which can be lessen through good table structure that match the data needed
3. Inconsistent code structure and variable naming convention. In update, $cuser = $request->\_\_authenticatedUser; was declared, in store API, it's not
4. Use of helper or service function.
5. User of curl/http. My preference when using Http requests is putting it in a service. Http requests are oftentimes global and should be bootstrapped in the kernel so it's faster and available anywhere
6. Too many APIs that can be handled well in the REST APIs
7. Naming of functions not explaining the purpose of function. I'd rather name a function long than give a short confusing name
8. Didn't use separation of concerns.
   Examples:
   if user have no power to access an api, use Middleware rather than blocking in repository.
   requests should be validated in the Request rather than returning $response['error'] in the logic itself.
   response should be formed in the Resource, so that you don't have to format it in the repository. Should return JobResource with status code 200, 404 etc.
   some logic should be handled in queues or jobs depends on the memory consumption
   should also maximized Model. Add scopes, mutators, casts etc. many could be done in Model than in repository.

Good

1. Usage of repository. logic should not be in controllers
2. Usage of config than env().
3. Pagination
4. Early returns

I am more familiar with this structure:

- Service for store/update/delete or 'write' methods
- Repository for 'index/show' or 'read' methods

I included comments in the code, and summarized it here.

\*Index API

I'd rather use in_array() than || condition for readability
I use config to secure the env and because config is cacheable
Most of the time, I use early returns so that the program doesn't need to run anymore if there's an issue
I also minimize the use of else if and else
No Pagination???

\*Show API

I just used findOrFail for handling possible id issues.
I can also use Request to check if id is existing

\*Store API

In store api, I'd rather use Request class (StoreJobRequest) and get $request->validated() data.
In the repository part, here are my comments:
Some parts should be handled in the middleware part
Custom validations for responses
Use of ternary operation for code readability
Declare variables only when necessary
Data and Response should have the same value?
Can implement queue/job since data is big and might affect runtime.
public function jobToData($job) can be reused in formatting the data in store api

\*Update API

Repository is good, it uses functions, code is not populated so much, unlike in store

\*immediateJobEmail API

Isn't it supposed to be executed with store api?

\*getHistory, getPotentialJobs API

should be in the index API
in Index API, add parameter $request->filter() and value is history so we don't have to create another api for history.

\*acceptJob, acceptJobWithId, cancelJob, endJob, customerNotCall, reopen

All these APIs can be included in the update API since there are just used to update job status

\*distanceFeed

logic in the controller, should be in the repository. Also api name is not easily understood

\*resendNotifications and resendSMSNotifications can be made in one API only.
